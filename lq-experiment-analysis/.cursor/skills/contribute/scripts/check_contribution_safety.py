"""Nothing leaves a clinician's laptop without passing through here.

The people who edit these skills are physicians, and they edit them *while working on real
manuscripts, real registries, and real patients*. A local edit can therefore carry, without
anyone intending it: a patient identifier, a hospital name, an IRB approval number, a
manuscript ID under review, a co-author's name, an email address, or an absolute path with
the user's own account name in it. A contribution flow that simply uploads "the files you
changed" is a PHI leak with a friendly button on it.

So this gate runs on the exact text that would be sent, and it is the load-bearing part of
the /contribute skill.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a guarantee. No pattern list can recognise every patient name or
every hospital, and a scanner that is *believed* to be complete is more dangerous than no
scanner at all, because it replaces the human check. This tool exists to (a) stop the obvious
leak and (b) put every questionable line in front of the person who wrote it. The contract of
the skill is that the author reads the diff — every line — and confirms. The scan narrows what
they must think hardest about; it does not do their thinking.

Verdicts (all block by default; the author may override an individual finding with a reason):
  PHI_SUSPECTED      a patient-level identifier (MRN-like ID, national ID, date of birth,
                     accession/study UID). Never overridable — see below.
  IDENTITY           a personal name, email address, or phone number
  INSTITUTION        a hospital / clinic / medical-centre name
  APPROVAL_ID        an IRB / ethics approval or exemption number
  MANUSCRIPT_ID      a journal submission ID (a manuscript under review is confidential)
  LOCAL_PATH         an absolute path containing the user's account name
  SECRET             an API key or token

PHI_SUSPECTED is not overridable by this script. If a line looks like patient data, the
correct action is to delete the line, not to argue with the scanner.

Exit code: **1 if anything at all was found** — this gate fails closed. A tool that returns
success while printing a hospital name is a tool that will eventually be trusted to have said
nothing. `--warn-only` suppresses that for inspection, but never in the contribution flow, and a
patient-level finding still fails even then.

Usage:
    check_contribution_safety.py --changes qc/local_changes.json [--out qc/safety.json]
    check_contribution_safety.py --text some_file.md          # scan one file

Stdlib only.

#
# This got both directions wrong at once, which is worth keeping in view because it is this repo's
# most common detector defect wearing a new hat:
#
#   MISSED  the revision suffix. `\d{3,6}\b` cannot match a five-digit serial followed by `R1`
#           (R is a word character, so there is no boundary), so EVERY revised ID was invisible.
#           Revised IDs are the ones a reviewer handles most, and one had been sitting in a shipped
#           reviewer profile in this repository. Writing the offending literal here would have put
#           it straight back into a public file -- the repo's own precedent gate caught that too.
#   FIRED   `10.7326/ANNALS-25-02104` — a published DOI. Annals of Internal Medicine mints DOIs in
#           exactly this shape, so the vendored QUADAS-3 checklist citing its own source tripped a
#           MAJOR finding.

# definition; a submission ID is the opposite.
