# Regression test for the /contribute safety gate and the local-change detector.
#
# The gate is the only thing standing between a clinician's laptop and a public commit. The
# positives are the things that must never be published: a patient identifier, a national ID, an
# IRB number, a manuscript under review, a colleague's name, a home directory, a credential.
#
# The negatives matter just as much. A contribution is a journal profile or a checklist fix, and
# it is full of ordinary clinical prose — "STROBE", "the corresponding author", "a tertiary-care
# hospital", "2,500 words". A gate that fires on those is a gate people route around, and the
# first thing they route around it with is the diff they never read.

The pipeline failed on patient MRN 4471903 during the review.
Subject 880101-1234567 was excluded after chart review.
Approved under IRB 2024-0451 at Severance Hospital.
Prof. Alan Poe suggested the change; reach me at a.poe@hospital.or.kr.

# The submission ID is ASSEMBLED, never written out: a file whose job is to carry identifier-shaped
# strings must not carry one as a literal, or the repo's own precedent gate flags the test that
# proves the gate works. Two forms, because the plain one shipped working and the revision one --
# the form a reviewer actually handles -- did not: `\d{3,6}\b` cannot match `00203R2` (R is a word
# character), so every revised ID was invisible until 2026-08-15.

# Korean Journal of Radiology — profile

- Body word limit: 3,000 words (excluding references)
- Abstract: structured, 300 words (Objective / Materials and Methods / Results / Conclusion)
- References: Vancouver, first three authors then et al.
- AI policy: generative AI may not be listed as an author; use must be disclosed in the Methods.
- Reporting: STROBE for observational work; STARD for diagnostic accuracy.

Approved by the institutional review board of a tertiary-care hospital; the corresponding
author confirmed the word limit against the journal's public author guidelines in 2026.
Figures were exported at 600 dpi and the study enrolled 1,284 participants.
